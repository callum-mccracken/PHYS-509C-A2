\section{COVID-19 Study}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Sample size: 3330 people in Santa Clara County, California
    \item $N_{+,t}$ = 50 positive test results in test group
    \item Control group 1: 3324 people, definitely negative
    \item $N_{+,c1}$ = 16 positives in control 1
    \item Control group 2: 157 people, definitely negative
    \item $N_{+,c2}$ = 130 positives in control 2 (27 false negatives)
\end{itemize}

Calculate the Bayesian 95\% central interval on the fraction of people in Santa Clara County who actually had antibodies for COVID-19, marginalizing over the false positive and false negative rates. Assume flat priors on all parameters.




Submit a plot of the posterior distribution for the true incidence rate as well as your code or calculation.
